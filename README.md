# chime-clojure
A [Chime][chime] extension for Clojure.

## Overview

This Chime extension supports the [Markdown][markdown] markup language.

Still a work in progress. Could be worthwhile checking out the [Marksman][marksman] LSP server.

## Contributing and Collaboration

I'd love to hear from you! Get in touch via an issue or pull request.

I prefer collaboration, and would love to find ways to work together if you have a similar project.

I prefer indentation with tabs for improved accessibility. But, I'd rather you use the system you want and make a PR than hesitate because of whitespace.
